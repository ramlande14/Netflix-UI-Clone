# Netflix-UI-Clone
This is a clone of the Netflix homepage, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicates the layout and design of the Netflix homepage, including the navigation bar, movie/carousel section, footer, and other interactive UI elements. The goal of this project is to practice front-end web development skills by recreating a familiar UI.
